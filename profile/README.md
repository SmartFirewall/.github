# SmartFirewall

SmartFirewall is the security commerce arm of **Dye Security’s** a place where we build, sell, and run security focused products that normal people can actually use and afford.

Our work lives on two sides:

- **Storefronts** – stores that sell software, subscriptions, and services.
- **Infrastructure** – self hosted platforms like [`private-cloud`](https://github.com/SmartFirewall/private-cloud) that power those products behind the scenes.

---

## What we build

- **SmartFirewall Store Repos**  
  Opinionated themes and apps designed for security focused products and recurring subscriptions.

- **private-cloud**  
  Self hosted infrastructure that runs our internal tools, customer environments, and automation on hardware we control.

- **Internal Tooling**  
  CI/CD, monitoring, and security automation that keep everything repeatable and safe.

## How this organization fits into Dye Security’s

- **Dye Security’s (Enterprise)** manages global policies, billing, and high-level security.
- **SmartFirewall (Org)** hosts the repos that implement those policies in real products.
- **Individual repos** (like `private-cloud`) contain the actual code, infra, and docs the team works on.

---

## Repositories

- [`private-cloud`](https://github.com/SmartFirewall/private-cloud) core infra for running SmartFirewall services on self owned hardware.

More public and private repos will be added under this organization as SmartFirewall grows.
